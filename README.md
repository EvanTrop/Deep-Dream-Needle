# Deep-Dream-Needle
 Implementing the DeepDream concept in the deep learning framework Needle which was built throughout CMU's 10-714 course. Deep Dream involves taking a pretrained image classification model and performing gradient ascent on an input image so that it maximally activates a particular hidden layer (or group of layers) in the model.
